arinfopy
========

`arinfopy` is a parser for **ADSO/BIN** files written in python.

Since version 2.3.0 it can also write **ADSO/BIN** files thanks to Bruno Guillaume (Aria Techonologies).

It requires Python 3.5.x but it is also working with Python 2.7.x (unsupported).

Use
---

You can either use it as an ordinary executable: `$ ./arinfopy.py  filename` or as a python script: `$ python arinfopy.py filename`.

For more details and some options see help: `$ ./arinfopy.py -h`.

API
---

`arinfopy` can also be used an external module in other `python` scripts to acces **ADSO/BIN** files.

Features
--------

It currently supports ADSO/bin files generated by atmospheric dispersion models such as [SPRAY][spray] and others.

Installation
------------

In order to ues is at as a module library, you can install it with the `pip` utility in the active python installation,  as:
```
> pip install git+https://github.com/Simularia/arinfopy
```

> cd arinfopy
> ln -s arinfopy.py ~/bin/arinfo
> arinfo test_file.bin
```

Who Are You?
------------

We are [Simularia][simularia] and we do numerical simulations of 
atmospheric phenomena and data analysis with `R` and `Python`.
